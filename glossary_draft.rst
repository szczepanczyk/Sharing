Blockchain general terms
==========================

**51% Attack** |br|
An attack on the distributed ledger that results in miners group has controlled more than 50% of the mining hash rate of the network. The term “Attack,” is used mostly in context to Bitcoin.

A

**Address** |br|
Address refers to a string of alphanumeric characters or scannable QR code, which is used to transmit and receive transactions on the network. The address is an essential term in the cryptocurrency, generated using the private key.

**Airdrop** |br|
Airdrop means distributing the free tokens to stakeholders as rewards. Airdrop is related to the blockchain projects, especially ICOs. Also, it might or might not include an incentive. Many blockchain projects perform airdrop for various reasons like community growth, fixing the bugs or incentivize a positive effort towards their idea.

.. _Accidental Fork:

**Accidental Fork** |br| 
An Accidental Fork happens when two or more miners select the block simultaneously. Then, one chain becomes longer than other. Also, the network abandons blocks that are not included in the long chain. These blocks are referred to as “`orphan blocks`_.” |br| *→ See also:* Fork_

**Agreement Ledger** |br| 
is considered as `distributed ledger`_ (DL), where two or more parties use it to negotiate and reach an agreement.

**ASIC** |br| 
stands for *Application Specific Integrated Circuit*, also referred to Silicon Chip is created to do a single task with significant power savings. ASICs are more efficient as compared to conventional hardware like CPU and GPU. *ASIC* is designed to process `SHA-256`_ hashing problems for mining more bitcoins.

**API** |br| 
Application Programming Interface (API) is referred to be a software intermediary that enables two different applications to interact with each other. These interfaces define ways to do communication between several components.

Capital ‘B’ in Bitcoin refers to the Bitcoin network.

**bitcoin** |br| 
Lowercase ‘b’ in bitcoin refers to the token/cryptocurrency bitcoin.

.. _Blockchain:

**Blockchain** |br| 
a distributed ledger that comprises of immutable records. Each block is then linked to the next block with a cryptographic signature. It enables block chains to be used like a ledger that can be shared and accessed by anyone having the right permissions. The blockchain is the transparent ledger that is used to save identities, value, agreements, credentials and property rights. Once you add something to the ledger, it will stay there forever. |br|

**Confirmation** |br| 
means the transactions occurred on the blockchain has been verified by the network. It happens through a process called mining in P-O-W system. When a transaction is confirmed, it cannot be double spent or reversed. As much as confirmations the transaction has, the harder it becomes to make a double spend attack.

**Consensus Algorithm**  is the blockchain element that determines how consensus is reached on that blockchain. In other words; it is the part of the blockchain protocol that describes who gets to validate blocks of data (and thus is entitled to the reward) and how others can verify its legitimacy.
