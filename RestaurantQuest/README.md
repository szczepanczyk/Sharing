# Restaurant Quest Readme

This folder contains all the materials for this project: Where to open a Chinese Restaurant in Amsterdam?
External libraries and APIs are used:
* Numpy
* pandas
* matplotlib
* folium map
* TomTom API or Foursquare API (in separate files)


## Background
There are two parts of the this project:

1. Dermographic data analysis
2. Examine surroundings by using a map and POI API.

## How to view this project

Because github does not support folium map natively.
In order to best experience interactive maps, use [Jupyter nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org) to view ipynb files.
For example, the full story using TomTom API is like [this](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/xding78/Sharing/blob/master/RestaurantQuest_TomTomAPI_Full.ipynb).
